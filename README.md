# Port Scanner

## Overview
This project is a simple port scanner written in Python. It allows the user to scan a range of ports on a target IP address to check whether they are open or closed. Port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports and services available on a host, which can be useful for network troubleshooting or security assessments.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## How to Run the Port Scanner

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: If you don't have VS Code installed, download it from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 2: Open the Project in VS Code
1. Open **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.
2. Go to `File` > `Open File...` and select the `port scanner.py` file.

### Step 3: Run the Port Scanner
1. Open a new terminal in VS Code by pressing:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + ` (backtick key).
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + ` (backtick key).
2. Run the code

### Example Usage
1- Start the program in VS Code as described above.
2- Enter the target IP (e.g., 127.0.0.1 for localhost).
3- Enter a port range (e.g., 20 to 80).
4- View the output in the terminal to see which ports are open or closed.
### Notes
1- This tool should be used for legitimate purposes only, such as testing your own network or with permission from the network owner.
2- Scanning ports on unauthorized networks may violate laws or policies, so ensure you have the right to scan the target IP.
